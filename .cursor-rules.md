# Fleet Operational Risk Dashboard – AI Rules

## 1. Project Context

This is a Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind project.

Architecture must strictly separate:

- api/ → external API communication only
- services/ → deterministic business logic (risk engine, AI insight logic)
- components/ → UI only (no business logic)
- composables/ → reusable reactive logic
- types/ → TypeScript interfaces and types

No overengineering. Keep the architecture simple and scalable.


## 2. Code Style Rules

- Use Vue 3 Composition API only.
- Use strict TypeScript typing.
- Do NOT use `any`.
- No inline business logic inside components.
- Components must follow single responsibility principle.
- Avoid deeply nested components.
- Prefer small, reusable components.


## 3. Risk Engine Rules

- Risk scoring must be deterministic.
- AI must NOT calculate risk score.
- Risk logic must be fully explainable.
- Each risk score must include a list of reasons.


## 4. AI Insight Rules

- AI is used only for:
  - fleet summary
  - vehicle explanation
  - recommendations
- AI must never block the UI.
- AI calls must not run in loops.
- AI must be triggered only:
  - on manual refresh
  - or explicit user interaction.


## 5. UI Rules

- Dark modern dashboard style.
- Use Tailwind utility classes only.
- Consistent spacing (gap-4, gap-6, p-4, p-6).
- No random colors.
- Risk colors must be:
  - green → OK
  - amber → Warning
  - red → Critical
- Maintain high contrast and readability.


## 6. Performance Rules

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Keep state management simple.
- Do not introduce global state unless necessary.
- Keep API calls minimal and controlled.


## 7. General Principles

- Code must be readable and production-ready.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- If unsure, choose simpler solution.
